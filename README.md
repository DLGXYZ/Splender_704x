# Splender_704x
This project is essentially an Ender 3 kitbash project that combines 3 basic kits into 1, wider 3D printer: X (704mm) Y (230mm) Z (250mm)
Feel free to download any or all the files for this build.
I'm sure the documentation is not perfect as I'm new at this sort of thing.
If you do need further guidance however, feel free to send me an email and I'll try to help.

Stay tuned for any updates and upgrades.
My only request from you is that if you create your own, please tag me in your post and send me pics/video.
It would warm my heart if it multiplied.
